The website starting with "index.html" file

Few Points to highlight:-

1) I designed it from the scratch and only contents are taken from original websites like article, images etc.
2) In Admin mode, we are allowed to change the text on the current webpage, refreshing it will restablish the original webpage.
3) All the students and faculty profiles are not defined, only some of them are defined properly. More content can be added later on.
4) Ramesh Lognathan sir, vasudev verma sir, Lalit Mohan profiles are well made.
